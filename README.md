# Falling Sand Simulator

Try here - https://sand-simulator-by-peedasaur.netlify.app/

A simple project where you draw sand and it... falls. Like real sand. That’s pretty much it.

You can change the brush size, pick a color, turn on rainbow mode if you're feeling wild, and There's a "Clear" button too, for when everything goes wrong.

No setup. No dependencies. Just open `index.html` and start messing around.

## How to Use

- Slide the brush size if your sand is too small.
- Pick a color if white bores you.
- Rainbow mode makes things chaotic.
- “Clear” button = panic reset.
